# Install-OpenCV-with-Python-on-Ubuntu

Environments that I used: Ubuntu16.04, Python2.7 and OpenCV3.

Basically followed instructions in http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu/

But including scripts for how to solve problems that may be encountered during the installation.
